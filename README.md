 From flight school to managing casino floors, I’ve had a range of experiences, but a few years ago I decided to shift focus and pursue what I’m truly passionate about: tech. Since then, I’ve been building real tools with real outcomes, turning a self-taught skillset into a full-time career as a software engineer.

I’ve had opportunities building data tools and internal apps for clients in environmental science and lead generation. Right now, I’m actively looking for full-time roles where I can keep learning, contribute meaningfully, and ship work that matters.

## Projects I’ve Built

- **Lead List Tool** — asynchronous Python tool that gathers and aggregates business data into a PostgreSQL database, enabling fast, keyword-targeted lead generation.
- **PetroTact Solutions** — oil spill calculator that recommends cleanup strategies based on coastal substrate and goals. Built with Python and Flet.
- **NASA Explorer** —  tool to search and explore NASA’s image and video archive. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS. will be adding more functionality! Work in progress

## Tools I Use

- Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- PostgreSQL,  
- Flet,  
- Git, GitHub, Netlify  

## What I'm Learning Now

- MERN stack 



## Currently Looking For

I’m actively looking for entry level software engineering roles. Open to remote, hybrid or on-site work.
